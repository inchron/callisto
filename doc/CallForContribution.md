# Call For Contribution

With our project we suggest a design flow, which uses inputs from system modelling 
tools, silicon vendors, operating system and middleware creators, tracing tools, and 
simulation and analysis tool providers. The main intention of the data model is to 
enable a standardized exchange of detailed information between those parties.

If you want to contribute, please do not hesitate to contact the project team via 
<callisto (at) inchron.com> (closed mailing list).
